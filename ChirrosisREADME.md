# **DATA 3402 - Tabular Kaggle Project : Prediction Chirrosis Outcome**

## **Overview** 
In this kaggle project, the challenge was to make a multi-class approach to predict the the outcomes of patients with cirrhosis. 

## **About the Dataset** 
Link to Dataset : [Multi-Class Prediction of Cirrhosis Outcomes](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s3e26/overview)
- Tabular
- Evaluated using the multi-class logarithmic loss, where each ID in the test set is assigned a single true class label named "Status."
- The submission containing predicted probabilities for 3 potential outcomes: Status_C, Status_CL, and Status_D for each ID.
